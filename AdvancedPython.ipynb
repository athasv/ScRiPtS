Welcome to Advanced Python!. In this course we are going to be covering some of the more advanced features of this programming language. We will finish off by looking at the Pandas programming library in depth and then try our hand at some plotting using Matplotlib and Seaborn.\n","\n","This course makes the following assumptions:\n","* You are familiar with the Python programming language and the basic data structures\n","* You have an understanding of the term \"Object Orientated Programming\" and you know about class structures\n","* Your primary interest is to use Python for data science and scientific programming\n","\n","If all the above don't quite match your experience or needs, please don't panic. You can find an introduction course to Python here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kDcuG1C0fI-wzoKvae2VIPHpPum2J1DT\n","\n","If you have other plans for Python that are outside of the Data Science world, come speak to me after the class and I can point you in the right direction. But I promise regardless of your needs, this course will help your Python understanding.\n","\n","<h2>Primer: Welcome to Jupyter Notebooks</h2>\n","\n","Welcome to the world of Notebooks! Now, there are many tools you can use to write Python code - simple text editors (e.g. Vim, Notepad++, Atom) or integrated development enviroments, IDEs (e.g. PyCharm, Visual Studio Code). The reason I am introducing you with Jupyter Notebooks is because it allows for something called \"literate programming\". Code is presented in snippets, contained in cells and executed in real-time, allowing for 'interative programming'. Either side of this code, the programmer has the ability to include written english, contained in 'markdown' cells.\n","\n","Jupyter notebooks provides you with a kind of 'programmers lab book'. You can document your code as you go along but also document your thought process, all whilst working in an enviroment that allows you to iterate over your work and develop efficient and affective programs.\n","\n","We are currently working on Google Colab, an online notebook very similar to Jupyter Notebook. To install Jupyter Notebooks locally, I would suggest you install <a href=\"https://www.anaconda.com/download/\">Anaconda</a>. This is a free distribution of both Python and R all in one big package, with all the data science libraries that you need along with Jupyter Notebook and R Studio, among other software.\n","\n","For now, we will be working in Colab only. If you haven't done so already, please open in 'Playground Mode'; go to `file` -> `open in playground mode`\n","\n","You can add and control cells using the commands on the toolbar at the top of the page. The `code` button adds a code cell, this is what you type your Python code into. The `text` button creates a markdown cell. These cells take written english but can also accept HTML formatting.\n","\n","<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>\n","\n","1. Using Python locally and the Python package manager `pip`\n","2. Strings, template strings and f-strings \n","3. List comprehension\n","4. Pythons built-in utility functions\n","5. Introduction to the functional paradigm\n","6. Advanced Pandas\n","7.

Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming language, but is a bundled package designed for scientific programming.

A package manager allows you to install packages (another name for library) so you can use them locally. \n","\n","Python actually has it's own package manager called `pip`. We can use `pip` to install the packages we need. For practice, we are going to run `pip` in our notebook. Because we are in a Colab notebook, we have to tell the notebook that we are running a bash command (a command usually found in the command line). We do this by prefixing our code with an exclamation mark.\n","\n","Later on we are going to use a library called `seaborn`, but more specifically we are going to use a certain version of `seaborn`.

Introduction to the Functional Paradigm</h2>\n","\n","First off, what the hell is a 'paradigm'? This is just a fancy word to describe \"how\" you do something. There are two main paradigm's in programming, Object Orientated Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming. Think of it like Muay Thai and Taekwondo, they are both trying to achieve the same thing but going about it different ways. Now some people will argue that one is better than the other and people in each camp are always bad-mouthing those in the other camp. But like with martial arts, the person who knows both and can use both interchangeably (the mixed martial artist) tends to win.\n","\n","Python allows for both programming paradigms. But what is the difference?\n","\n","* OOP - this is probably the paradigm you're most familar with at the moment, especially if you attended my intro course. It is based around the concept of creating objects which inherit properties and methods from classes. OOP is heavily based around abstraction and inheritance.\n","* Functional - this paradigm focuses on treating a problem as a series of mathematical functions that can be evaluated in any order and are not dependant upon some outside state. This idea of `state` is really important. In a functional paradigm you treat everything as immutable.\n","\n","We've actually been using a functional paradigm already, I just didn't tell you. List comprehension is functional and borrowed from Haskell, a purely functional language.\n","\n","The real advantages of a functional paradigm are: avoiding mutable states (which can be dangerous), cleaner code, and parallel programming (functions can be executed together in parallel).\n","\n","That being said, Python is not a functional programming language, it merely borrows some of the better concepts from functional programming. You should not avoid using mutable objects all together but instead learn from functional programming to create cleaner more efficient code. The easiest way to do this is, when doing something in python ask **do I really want to change X or do I want a new X?**\n","\n","The operations that we discuss next become really useful for scripting: programming mostly conducted in the field of data science where operations are often applied to large amounts of data that flow in one direction in a pipeline to generate some sort of output.\n","\n","Let's get started with some of the functional operators provided by Python, we'll cover them in this order:\n","\n","* lambda\n","* map\n","* filter"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4xVwEm3Ak2l5","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<h3>Lambda - creating anonymous functions</h3>\n","\n","Lambda allows us to create \"unnamed\" or \"anonymous\" functions.

\"Great! we have the merged data, let's move on\". I'm afraid not. I've done the above as an exercise to demonstrate to you how pivoting and merging works, but the result is not very useful. It is not very useful because it is not **tidy**.\n","\n","Tidy data looks like so:\n","\n","<img src=\"http://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-4.png\">\n","\n","Tidy data should have individual columns for each variable and there data \"types\" should not be mixed. We have created a \"wide\" table with mixed datatypes.\n","\n","You might think this seems a bit pedantic but it is really important when we start looking at plotting data in the final section of this tutorial. Let's say for example you want to plot all the job sectors against one another on a line plot, with number of jobs on the y-axis and date on the x-axis. Each element of this plot will be defined as an object and each object will relate back to the underlying data. The job sector is a variable - it relates to each line on the plot and is a property of each data point - we would therefore need to specify a column for this variable.....but that column doesn't exist.\n","\n","What we are going to do, is not merge the datasets. They contain different \"types\" of data - one is the number of jobs the other is price. They can be related on their `date` column, now that they are equal.\n","\n","The employment table needs changing though. It needs to be converted to a tidy format, with a column for `employment_sector` and a column for the values which we will call `number_of_jobs`.  We will use the old `stocks` DataFrame (the one we have not reshaped) moving forward. \n","\n","When we reshaped `stocks` we used the `pivot` method. This is used to spread rows out into columns. What we want to do now is **gather** the columns into rows. We want to make a new column called `job_sector`which contains what is currently in the column names.\n","\n","To do this we will use the `melt` method. Again the <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.melt.html\">documentation</a> for this is amazing. We want to specify three arguments:\n","* id_vars: the column we want to keep as an identifier for each row, which for use is the date\n","* var_name: the name of our new `variable` column\n","* value_name: the name of our column containing the `values` of the `variables`\n","\n","I'm going to demonstrate on a quick example dataset and then I want you to perform the `melt` method on the employment dataset."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"yJetG5i2dMz3","colab_type":"code","outputId":"c7f13b9a-2bf0-456b-f405-ee1d61cb5646","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1555586577416,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":518,"user":{"displayName":"Ross
